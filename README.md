# ReactWebRTC

For the CS494 (Advanced Web Development) final project, we are going to build a web application that allows users to video chat and text chat with each other.

I thought I'd be fun to play around with WebRTC prior, so I'm building this pet project to get familiar with the technology.

## What is WebRTC?

WebRTC is a free, open source standars that provides browsers and mobile applications with Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) capabilities via simple APIs. The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose.
